The digital walking app is a group project as part of the TechUP Software Skills Developer Bootcamp.

The aim of the digital walking group is to create a social space online where older residents of the Merley North area can find walking groups. 
By joining a walking group members can find new places to walk and meet new people, helping to reduce loneliness and promote excercise.
